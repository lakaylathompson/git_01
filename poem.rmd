## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,  
   Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
   The billows smooth and bright—  
And this was odd, because it was  
   The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
   Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
   After the day was done—  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
   "To come and spoil the fun!"  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In a realm of green, where truffula trees sway,  
Lies a tale of nature, in hues of every ray.  
In a land where once a Lorax spoke,  
Of a world out of balance, its fragile cloak.  

He stood with a voice, like a whispering breeze,  
Guardian of forests, protector of trees.  
With a mustache that curled, and eyes full of care,  
He warned of greed, that hung thick in the air.  

"Unless," he implored, "we change our ways,  
The beauty of nature will soon fade away."  
But greed knew no bounds, it cared not for rhyme,  
And the Lorax watched sadly, as trees fell in their prime.  

Yet amidst the despair, a seed of hope grew,  
In the hearts of those who knew what to do.  
For the Lorax's message, though somber and grim,  
Sparked a movement, a call to protect what was dim.  

So let us remember, as we tread on this earth,  
The Lorax's wisdom, of infinite worth.  
For in every whisper of wind, in each leaf's gentle sway,  
Resides the spirit of the Lorax, guiding our way.
